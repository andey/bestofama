After that experience, I moved on to the band of the Blackhearts, which was an all guy band except for me because I did not want comparisons to the Runaways.  \n\nSome of our big hits were \"Crimson in Clover,\" \"I hate myself for loving you,\" \"I love Rock n Roll,\" \"Do you wanna touch me\" and \"Bad Reputation.\" \n\nI've done a couple of movies.  I executively produced \"The Runaways\" which starred Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning and told the story to a degree of the Runaways.\n\nI have a new album, Unvarnished, and it's really important to me. https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/unvarnished-deluxe-edition/id684303774\n\nThe single Any Weather I wrote with Dave Grohl.  You can watch it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkhv4TXt_iM\n\nAsk me anything. \n\ntweeted in advance: https://twitter.com/joanjett/status/387279834247749632\n\nThanks everybody for so many amazing questions.  I'm sorry I could not get to everything so let's do this again sometime soon.

An exercise which started in a basement in Edmonton with a throw of the dart which first took us to North Pole, and now we&amp;#39;re headed for its second mission, to the crime-inflicted lands of Russia to help homeless orphans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the dart first ordered us to visit North Pole, we had absolutely no budget. We had to make the trip in December when Svalbard sees no sun, the temperatures are colder than your mother in law, and those cute Polar Bears reddit adores are actively hunting for humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l1CcbPNYdk\"&gt;We raised money using this video&lt;/a&gt;. Although we did not make enough to cover all the costs, we were still determined to make the trip and help the polar bear extinction cause. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and we donated as much as we could to The World Wildlife Fund. That&amp;#39;s when we decided to throw another dart and make the second trip based of faith. This time around though, we decided to take it to a different level. Bigger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We organized a fundraiser, raised funds, auctioned a chance to the highest bidder to come along with us (Cindy Mitchell, a 56-yr old cancer survivor took that leap of faith and would be joining us for the trip) and also auctioned the dart-throw.

An exercise which started in a basement in Edmonton with a throw of the dart which first took us to North Pole, and now we're headed for its second mission, to the crime-inflicted lands of Russia to help homeless orphans. \n\nWhen the dart first ordered us to visit North Pole, we had absolutely no budget. We had to make the trip in December when Svalbard sees no sun, the temperatures are colder than your mother in law, and those cute Polar Bears reddit adores are actively hunting for humans.\n\n\n[We raised money using this video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l1CcbPNYdk). Although we did not make enough to cover all the costs, we were still determined to make the trip and help the polar bear extinction cause. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and we donated as much as we could to The World Wildlife Fund. That's when we decided to throw another dart and make the second trip based of faith.
